<h3>What is Yoga?</h3>
<p>Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines practiced in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, with a wide variety of practices and goals. The word yoga is derived from the Sanskrit root yuj, meaning “to yoke,” or “to unite”. The practice aims to create union between body, mind and spirit, as well as between the individual self and universal consciousness. Such a union tends to neutralize ego-driven thoughts and behaviours, creating a sense of spiritual awakening.</p>
